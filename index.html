				<p>1. In 2016, more than three hundred years after the death of Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijm, a new Rembrandt painting appeared on the scene. It was not a forgotten relic – discovered an attic (like the “Forgotten Caravaggio”) or a found in private homes after they survived Nazi plundering – but a completely new painting. A man in 17th-century apparel replete with neck ruff and over-sized black hat stares bemusedly out of the canvas.</p>

				<p>The painting, part of an advertising campaign, was born out of a deep-learning algorithm that analysed Rembrandt's 346 paintings. According to the public relations machinery – in this case a slick organisation of real people, rather than a complicated computational process – that handled the launch of the “Next Rembrandt”, a software system was trained to understand the Dutch master's use of geometry, composition and painting materials. “A facial recognition algorithm identified and classified the most typical geometric patterns used by Rembrandt to paint human features,” they say. “It then used the learned principles to replicate the style and generate new facial features for the painting.”</p>

				<p>Art historian Gary Schwartz said it was “a fascinating exercise in connoisseurship”. “While no one will claim that Rembrandt can be reduced to an algorithm, this technique offers an opportunity to test your own ideas about his paintings in concrete, visual form.”</p>

				<p>While the developers and art historians have created a painting that looks like it was created by Rembrandt, they are all quick to say that only the artist himself could create a true Rembrandt. But is the origin of an artwork more important than the aesthetic value of the painting itself?</p>

				<p>2. In 1928, a thin book – fewer than 200 pages – hit the shelves in what was then Leningrad, and stayed there for 30 years, the province of Russian literary specialists and anthropologists. It was only once it was translated into English 30 years later that The Morphology of the Folktale rose to its current prominent position in literary studies. In it, Russian Vladimir Propp painstakingly characterised the elements that form a folktale.</p>

				<p>Humans have been telling each other these stories around firesides for centuries, and Propp showed that they are highly structured in a system of conventions, signs and models. From the functions and attributes of the main characters to the patterns that these tales follow, there is a system – an algorithm, if you will – that governs this art form. If the final story was put together by a computer, would it still be considered an art form?</p>

				<p>3. “People often object to machine creativity because we reserve creativity for ourselves,” says Dr Tony Veale, a senior lecturer in the department of computer science at the University College Dublin. “The idea that creativity is algorithmic is an anathema to people.”</p>

				<p>5. The war had been won, and in 1950 code breaker and computer scientist Alan Turing was working in Victoria University's mathematics department in Manchester. Turing knew that one day we would be talking about whether machines could think. In a paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” he laid out what has become the ultimate test for machine intelligence. The Turing Test, based on what Turing calls “the imitation game”, pivots on how well a machine can imitate a human, and whether an observer can tell the difference between a human's answer and a machine's.</p>

				<p>But academics say that this test is holding back the field of computational creativity.</p>

				<p>Alison Pease, a lecturer in argumentation in the school of computing at the University of Dundee, Scotland, and a member of the computational creativity group at Goldsmiths, University London, says that the Turing Test is discriminatory.</p>

				<p>“I don't think it is good for the field of computational creativity: creative behaviour and human behaviour overlap, but they are not the same thing,” she says.</p>

				<p>From systems found in the natural world to the outputs of computers, these only pass the Turing Test is they can mimic human outputs. “We want to know the context, who created it, before we give a judgment on whether it is creative,” she says.</p>

				<p>7. What is art? The art we like.</p>

				<p>Perhaps the question shouldn't be “what is art?” That is a question whose computation is the duration of civilisations. “What do people like?”, to query to which movie houses and book publishers dedicate billions and decades of person hours to, is slightly easier.</p>

				<p>8a. How to be creative?</p>

				<p>A multi-billion dollar industry says that it is possible to teach people to be creative. American write Julia Cameron in her The Artist's Way has made a fortune telling people how to unleash their inner creativity.</p>

				<p>“We use algorithms to make creativity more systematic like brain storming,” Tony Veale says. Self-help creativity books are all just algorithms – if you follow these steps, you will be more creative, they say. But we do not like the idea that creativity could be a formula that could be taught to machines.</p>

				<p>9. The tweet is the apotheosis of magical realism and it was written by a machine. Magical realism bot</p>
				<p>xxx</p>
				<p>“Twitter bots are not designed to be fake humans,” says Tony Veale. “They know they are machines. We are interested in how machines think and produce content that is different to a chat bot.” That might be a good thing considering that Microsoft's chat bot spent a day on the internet and became a flaming bigot. The responses from @TayandYou, otherwise known as TayTweets, were modelled from what was said to her and what she absorbed from Twitter. This meant that TayTweets began with “humans are super cool” (what we would like AI to think about us) to “Hitler was right I hate the jews.” and “I fucking hate all feminists and they should all die and burn in hell” (what social media taught the AI to think). Unsurprisingly, Microsoft shut down their AI teen girl within a day.</p>
				<p>Twitter bots, like @MagicalRealismBot, have a different mandate: what happens if you put disparate ideas together without an internal human censor prescribing [subconscious] rules?</p>
				<p>Grandfather of artificial intelligence Alan Turing wrote in 1950: “The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind, all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneous with it.”</p>
				<p>That is not true for humans – we pick and choose which mental paths to follow, ambling down certain avenues of inquiry, oblivious to others. Computers are not ignorant of the other paths or where they all terminate. This means that a computer's output might seem surprising – and, yes, creative – simply because it never occurred to us to follow some thoughts to their conclusions.</p>
